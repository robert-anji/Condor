Clock implementation:

- Would be nice to just have a simple counter to represent the clock edges

- That would be straight forward if there was only one clock

- Multiple clocks is also straightforward if each clock is an integer multiple of the fastest clock

- Problem is that the time period may not be an integer value, example 300MHz is 3.33ns, solution: use float?
